Please choose your level of agreement with the statements using the options given. ,Here is a reminder of the scenario in case you need it. Please take into account that all the questions will make reference to it:  Crimson One is an Australian construction business that builds residential properties in Australia. The business has around 300 employees. Crimson One has been operating for over ten years and its financial situation is very good. One day Crimson One owners decide to increase their profits and start employing cheaper materials to construct houses in low-income Australian suburbs where it can go unnoticed. The strategy is a success for Crimson One and the business owners decide to stick with it. However several Australian house owners and tenants are eventually impacted by the use of cheap materials and they later find themselves spending money on house maintenance and repairs. ,Dir1,Dir2,Dir3,Dir4,Ind1,Ind2,Ind3,Ind4,,,,,,Eq1,Eq2,N1,N2,Des1,Des2,Dep1,Dep 2,Bla1,Bla2,Bla3,Iden1,Iden2,Iden3,Iden4,Iden5,Iden6,

Using lower quality materials is never good for anyone - the consumer or the company. It hurts everyone and I do not think the companies behavior was good in any way. Profit over safety and quality is never a good thing for anyone. ,,,7,1,7,1,7,7,3,1,7,7,1,7,46,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,6,39

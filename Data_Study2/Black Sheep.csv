Please take into account that all the questions will make reference to it:  Crimson One is an American construction business that builds residential properties in the USA. The business has around 300 employees. Crimson One has been operating for over ten years and its financial situation is very good. One day Crimson One owners decide to increase their profits and start employing cheaper materials to construct houses in low-income US suburbs where it can go unnoticed. The strategy is a success for Crimson One and the business owners decide to stick with it. However several American owners and tenants are eventually impacted by the use of cheap materials and they later find themselves spending money on house maintenance and repairs. ,Dir1,Dir2,Dir3,Dir4,Ind1,Ind2,Ind3,Ind4,,,,,,Eq1,Eq2,N1,N2,Des1,Des2,Dep1,Dep 2,Bla1,Bla2,Bla3,Iden1,Iden2,Iden3,Iden4,Iden5,Iden6,

I think that Crimson One is not a very good construction business because they are using cheap materials to construct houses in low-income suburbs.

Using cheaper materials is not a good choice as it costs the home owner more in the long run due to repairs,,,5,3,5,3,6,2,5,2,5,5,6,6,43,2,2,2,6,2,2,6,5,2,6,6,6,6,7,6,7,6,38

"Its unethical and immoral to exploit low income purchasers without disclosing that they did so, especially given that it was to increase their own margins (not make housing more affordable for those buyers by passing the savings on to them).

I think their behavior is very selfish and greedy. They are not caring at all about the people that will be living in their buildings and the issue with safety.,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,3,7,7,7,5,54,1,1,5,5,1,1,6,6,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,42
"The companys decision to use cheaper and less durable materials, without any public disclosure about this, and the unfair targeting of this strategy against low-income buyers, constitute unethical business practices.  From a cynical business perspective it might be viewed as simply a profit-chasing strategy, but nevertheless these practices would ultimately fail to meet the truest standards of good business.  My opinion of the company and its behavior would be unfavorable, if they were to continue these practices as described.",,,6,2,6,2,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,48,2,2,6,6,2,2,6,6,2,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,42
I think it is a very low down thing to do. Build a reputation for quality work and material and then take advantage of customers who liked what they heard or read about the company by shorting them on quality for an increase in profit.,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,4,7,7,7,4,53,2,4,6,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,6,36

I do not have a very positive attitude towards them when they changed from wanting to build quality houses to using cheap materials to make more money.  I feel very bad for the people who bought those houses and now had to make repairs because of bad materials that crimson one used. Bad business practice. ,,,7,2,6,1,7,1,5,2,6,7,7,6,51,1,1,6,7,1,2,6,6,1,6,6,7,7,6,6,5,6,37

The behavior is unethical and demonstrates a high level of cruelty. The actions arent surprising and sadly more than likely a common practice.,,,7,1,6,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,55,1,1,7,7,1,1,6,7,1,7,7,4,3,4,3,4,3,21

What do you think about the behavior of Crimson One?,You will be presented with some statements. Please choose your level of agreement with the statements using the options given. ,Here is a reminder of the scenario in case you need it. Please take into account that all the questions will make reference to it:   Crimson One is an American construction business that builds residential properties in the USA. The business has around 300 employees. Crimson One has been operating for over ten years and its financial situation is very good. One day Crimson One owners decide to increase their profits and start employing cheaper materials to construct houses in low-income suburbs where it can go unnoticed. Employing cheap materials goes against the standards that almost every USA company in the same industry follow but Crimson One owners don’t mind. The strategy is a success for Crimson One and the business owners decide to stick with it. However many American homeowners and tenants are eventually impacted by the use of cheap materials and they later find themselves spending money on house maintenance and repairs. ,Dir1,Dir2,Dir3,Dir4,Ind1,Ind2,Ind3,Ind4,,,,,,Eq1,Eq2,N1,N2,Des1,Des2,Dep1,Dep 2,Bla1,Bla2,Bla3

"It goes against the grain of 'Made in the USA to last' .... As an outsider, and even an employee, would find it unsettling to know about the shortcuts taken that will cost the consumer for repairs and maintenance in the end.  They may be saving money, thus better profit, but in the future their reputation may decline due to the negative feedback they will most likely receive.  I also have to think that the profit is going into the pockets of the heavy hitters in their office, but not the working people who keep the business actually going.",,,6,2,6,2,6,1,5,2,6,6,7,6,48,2,2,4,6,2,2,6,6,1,7,7

I think it is unethical to use cheaper materials. They already are building these homes in low income neighborhoods so they know right away that these people will not be able to afford the repairs to their homes when these cheaper materials degrade. It is saddening and also angering that a company would do this. ,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,6,1,7,7,7,7,55,1,2,7,7,1,1,6,7,1,7,7

I think it is short-term thinking and not really ethical. It is not following industry standards and now consumers are paying the price with higher maintenance costs. It is likely that Crimson One's reputation will suffer and that long-term profitability will suffer.,,,6,2,6,2,6,2,2,5,6,6,6,3,41,2,2,5,5,1,1,6,6,1,7,7

The information I have been given says that other competitors or company's in the same industry do not use cheaper materials. Crimson One is sacrificing its quality, morality, humanity, and trustworthiness in order to make a larger profit. ",,,7,2,7,1,7,1,6,2,6,7,7,6,53,2,1,5,5,1,2,7,6,1,7,6
I think their behavior is immoral and wrong.,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,56,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7
This is unethical and possibly illegal depending on their tactics.,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,5,1,7,7,7,7,54,2,2,4,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7
I thought the behavior was improper and that it should not be profiting off such bad behavior. ,,,6,2,6,2,6,1,6,3,6,6,7,5,48,4,5,7,6,2,2,6,5,1,5,6
"I think it's sad that a company would resort to this type of behavior. Of course, this happens often in real life. That's a huge part of what's wrong with the US- greed.",,,7,1,6,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,55,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7
It is terrible.,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,56,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7
I believe that Crimson One's behavior is unethical and shortsighted. They're allowed to reap the benefits and profits of using cheap materials and passing on the responsibility of maintenance onto low income tenants who unknowingly assumed that responsibility and do not have the resources to  maintain.,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,56,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7

It is corrupt and negligent.,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,56,1,1,6,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7
It was not ethical for them to do this.  They hurt low-income people on purpose,,,6,2,6,2,6,1,5,2,6,6,7,6,48,2,2,2,6,5,6,6,6,2,5,6
It's unethical and they should be shut down or fined for it. ,,,7,1,7,2,7,1,6,2,7,6,7,6,53,3,3,5,5,2,2,6,6,2,7,6
I think their behavior is corrupt and reprehensible. They only care about their profits. They don't care about the quality of their buildings in low income areas as they know they can get away with lower quality there. That hurts the people who buy these homes.,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,5,1,7,7,7,7,54,1,1,7,7,2,1,7,7,1,1,7

I think it is awful. Just because people are poor does not mean their homes should be built with cheap materials and it will go unnoticed.,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,56,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7

"Well, they are free to do it, I suppose, as long as they aren't CLAIMING that they are doing otherwise. If so, then they are lying and being dishonest. As long as they are not claiming to be still using high quality materials, then I guess it's ok. But it's not OK to trick people and try to take advantage of poorer people who may not notice. So that seems wrong. In any case, long term it will probably hurt them and isn't a good idea. It's always a better plan to do the best job that you can do and to do the right thing by other people.

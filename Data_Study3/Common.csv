What do you think about the behavior of Crimson One?,You will be presented with some statements. Please choose your level of agreement with the statements using the options given. ,Here is a reminder of the scenario in case you need it. Please take into account that all the questions will make reference to it:  Crimson One is an American construction business that builds residential properties in the USA. The business has around 300 employees. Crimson One has been operating for over ten years and its financial situation is very good. One day Crimson One owners decide to increase their profits and start employing cheaper materials to construct houses in low-income suburbs where it can go unnoticed. Similar strategies have been widely implemented across the industry for the last months by other USA companies. Crimson One owners decide to follow suit and do the same even though they don’t need to do this in order to continue being profitable and competitive. The strategy is a success for Crimson One and the business owners decide to stick with it. However many American homeowners and tenants are eventually impacted by the use of cheap materials and they later find themselves spending money on house maintenance and repairs. ,Dir1,Dir2,Dir3,Dir4,Ind1,Ind2,Ind3,Ind4,,,,,,Eq1,Eq2,N1,N2,Des1,Des2,Dep1,Dep 2,Bla1,Bla2,Bla3

"The behavior of Crimson One is an unfortunate result of the business owners choosing short term profits over longer-term, more valuable customer satisfaction and referrals. The American homeowners and tenants now have to fix the building materials out of their own pocket while Crimson One reaps all the profits. This is an unfortunate situation that should be redressed in the courts by the homeowner and tenants making a case against Crimson One.",,,5,3,5,3,5,3,5,3,5,5,5,5,40,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7
I think the behavior of Crimson One is selfish.,,,7,2,6,1,7,1,6,2,6,7,7,6,52,1,1,6,6,1,1,7,7,1,7,7
"While I don't like it - based on the scenario, the behavior had evolved into a somewhat standard behavior for the industry.  Based on this, I understand why they made the decision they did.  At the same time, they could have promoted themselves by marketing initiatives making known the fact that they use higher quality materials than some competitors.  This alone may have increased their profitability because many consumers are interested in quality.  And based on the scenario, they were profitable prior to moving to lower quality materials, which makes me frown on them all the more.  Seems their move to inferior quality materials was based on greed.",,,6,1,7,1,2,1,1,5,7,7,7,3,40,6,7,4,5,2,4,7,6,1,7,7
I think it's unethical and unfair to do what they did just for their own profit. They are untrustworthy and not a company I would want to work with.,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,6,55,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7
The company CEO/mgmt needs to be fined and sent to jail.,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,56,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7
"I think that this type of behavior is uncalled for. If a person is buying a home then the construction company should build that home using the best materials. It takes most people at least 30 years to pay for their home, and this construction wants to cut corners just for a profit. In my opinion home should take these types of construction companies to court when they use cheap materials.",,,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,50,1,1,1,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7
"I honestly expect no less from a company that is successful. If a company can find a way to cut corners and costs so they profit from it, then they will do it. I think it's unfortunate too since Crimson One using cheaper materials ends up costing the homeowners in the long run, specifically the ones with low income. They'll have a much harder time repairing anything because they lack the money.",,,5,2,5,1,5,1,4,2,6,7,7,6,45,1,1,6,5,1,1,7,6,1,7,7

I think Crimson One's behavior is immoral and unethical and they should be ashamed of themselves. They should be held accountable. The people they are selling to are buying in good faith that they are getting a sound product.,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,56,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7

I think their behavior is awful.,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,56,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7

It's simple greed,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,56,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7
"I don't like it and I disapprove. It's nasty behavior to cheat people like that, especially when they don't even need to do it to stay competitive since they were already successful and making money, but even if they weren't, it would still be unethical and morally wrong to do it.",,,7,2,6,1,7,1,6,1,6,7,7,7,53,1,1,6,6,1,1,7,5,1,7,6
I think that it is highly immoral but I know that most construction companies are like this now in our society,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,6,1,7,7,7,7,55,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7
Horrible yet sadly typical in this day and age. Quality is pretty much a thing of the past.,,,7,2,7,1,7,1,7,2,6,7,7,6,54,2,2,7,7,2,1,7,6,1,7,7
I think it makes sense that a US business would do such acts..I think its wrong but it makes sense .,,,5,3,5,3,5,3,5,3,5,5,5,5,40,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7

It is definitly wrong to do this.,,,7,1,5,1,7,1,6,1,7,7,7,7,53,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7
It fits right in with the way the American capitalist society is going. Many companies are employing this same method across all areas of life. It is disheartening and should be illegal.,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,4,1,7,7,7,7,53,1,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,7
Cutting corners to make a quick buck wasn't necessary. They could have gone the route advertising their quality construction. They've taken the opportunity to make themselves average.,,,6,3,6,1,7,1,6,1,5,7,7,7,51,1,1,5,7,1,2,7,7,1,7,7
Bad idea. Any short term profit will eventually result in complaints and potential lawsuits down the line. Not to mention that it's a low-life thing to do - and completely unnecessary for the solvency and success of the company.,,,5,2,6,3,6,2,4,3,6,5,6,5,43,2,2,4,5,2,4,4,5,1,7,6
I feel this is deplorable but common in the industry.,,,6,2,7,2,6,1,5,2,6,6,7,6,49,4,2,6,6,1,1,6,5,1,7,6
"I believe that they are just following suit of the other companies and trying to maximize their profits. I do not see any harm in this as I'm sure most construction companies, as mentioned in the article do the same thing. It is more costly for the consumer down the road, however profitability wise, they did was any company would choose to do.",,,3,2,5,2,6,2,2,4,6,6,6,4,38,4,5,2,5,4,3,5,5,2,4,4
very unprofessional,,,7,2,7,1,7,1,7,1,6,7,7,7,55,1,1,7,7,1,1,6,6,1,7,6
"I think it was shady. Even though other companies may be doing the same, a company should pride themselves in not following suite and not engaging in shady business practices to make more money. Especially when it will cost the people who buy these homes more money in the long run.",,,6,2,6,2,7,1,7,2,6,6,7,6,51,1,1,5,6,1,1,7,5,2,5,5
Totally unprofessional for their personal gain. Untrustworthy to homeowners.,,,6,2,6,2,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,48,1,1,6,1,1,1,6,7,1,7,7
I think it is wrong,,,6,2,6,2,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,48,4,4,6,6,2,2,6,6,2,6,6
I feel this behavior is dishonest and unfair. The company was already profitable without resorting to shady tactics. Everyone deserves to receive the quality product they are paying for. It is regrettable that the homeowners end up paying the repair costs.,,,7,1,6,1,7,1,6,1,7,7,7,7,54,1,1,6,6,1,1,7,7,1,6,6
It is standard in this day and age for businesses. I think it's disgusting and everything wrong with our society and systems. Profit is not more important than people.,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,5,1,7,7,7,7,54,1,1,7,7,1,1,6,6,1,3,6
"At the end of the day, it is  nothing personal, just business.  It is not fair to judge one when so many others do the same.  Purchasing, being gifted, or provided with free housing does not consist of the best of the best or permanent.  It is temp to get you to your next level.",,,3,4,5,3,4,3,3,3,4,5,5,5,34,2,4,4,4,4,5,3,2,6,2,5

"I think the behavior of Crimson One is unfortunate and morally wrong. It makes sense that they would do it because they are in a capitalist society that values profit over people, but it was the wrong thing to do.",,,6,3,7,1,7,1,5,2,5,7,7,6,50,1,1,5,6,1,1,7,7,1,7,7
"Deplorable. They're already making a good profit, there's no need to make American homeowners suffer just to line their own pockets a little more. This is how we get into issues like the Surfside condo collapse.",,,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,56,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7
"I think it represents that companies value profits over people.  I feel that they should try to make a profit, but doing so in a way that negatively affects those in low income areas is reprehensible.  You can see in most industries how products now seem to have a short life span.  My mother's washer and dryer lasted decades and today the new fancy machines seem to crap out after a few years.  It is that same mentality for newer homes.  Build them cheap and quick to make more money, screw the homeowners.",,,7,2,7,1,7,1,6,1,6,7,7,7,54,1,1,7,6,1,1,6,7,1,6,4
it's bad,,,6,2,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,7,7,7,51,2,1,6,7,1,1,6,6,1,6,7

I feel their behavior was shameful and a true detriment to their customers.,,,7,2,7,1,7,1,7,1,6,7,7,7,55,2,6,2,6,1,1,6,7,1,7,7
Max the profits. ,,,4,3,5,3,4,3,5,3,5,5,5,5,38,1,1,6,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7
I think it's typical of a big business to try and take the cheaper route so they can spend less money. I don't agree with doing this at all because it hurts the employees and the consumers.,,,7,2,6,2,6,2,5,2,6,6,6,6,48,2,2,4,6,2,2,6,6,1,7,7
"I think it's horrible because it's not only dangerous, it also is unfair to people that are already having a hard time. It's disgusting that they would do this to people just because they know they won't face consequences due to the area.",,,7,1,6,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,55,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7

"It was immoral.  Although others in the industry do as well, Crimson One was generating a profit previous to its new strategy.  They didn't need to take this action.  It was strictly for profit and they knew the materials were substandard.",,,4,2,7,2,6,1,6,2,6,6,7,6,48,2,3,6,5,2,2,6,6,2,5,6

"This is quite common and unfortunately, most people don't know the difference when hiring a contractor and the difference between materials.  They're just concerned about cost and will sacrifice quality for a better price only to find down the line that things start falling apart.  Then they blame the contractor when they're the ones who made the decision originally.  Terrible because whoever buys the home later will end up with an inferior product.",,,7,1,5,1,7,1,2,1,7,7,7,7,49,4,6,7,7,2,3,7,7,2,7,7

"I think their behavior is a widely used practice, but I also think it's terrible. Poor people already struggle to make ends meet, and their sub-standard materials will cost poor people more money in repairs.

I think it was wrong of Crimson One to start employing cheaper materials in the low income suburbs, and it was also deceiving of them to knowingly do it in hopes of not being noticed. However, I think Crimson One was more inclined to participate in this behavior because of the similar strategies that had been implemented across the industry. Therefore, even though I think Crimson One was wrong for their behavior and should take responsibility, I think pressure from other similar strategies in the industry caused them to do something they otherwise might not have done.",,,5,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,7,7,7,7,51,2,2,6,6,3,1,6,6,1,6,6

"I think that it is a little bit questionable.  I think the use of the cheap materials, while allowing the company to be profitable, has negative impact on homeowners down the line as they have to pay for major repairs on their homes.",,,5,3,6,3,6,3,5,3,5,5,5,5,42,6,6,5,6,3,3,5,5,3,5,5
It's greedy and will end up costing them more in the long run when their reputation suffers and people move away from using them to using companies that use higher quality materials. I also think they're kind of jerks for skimping on quality in low-income areas and making the people that live in their shoddy homes suffer and have to pay more money to fix their on-purpose behavior.,,,7,1,6,1,7,1,5,1,7,7,7,7,53,1,1,6,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7
It is unethical ,,,6,1,7,2,7,1,6,1,7,6,7,7,53,1,2,5,6,1,1,7,7,2,7,5

It is abhorrent that a company would screw over low income people who probably scrimped and saved for years for a house and can not afford these repairs. It is even more hateful to only do this to low income people especially when they would not be able to afford the eventual repairs. This company is hateful and greedy. ,,,7,1,6,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,55,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7
I think it is unethical because that will put more strain on the homeowners or landlords to keep repairing their homes.,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,56,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,5,1,7,6
I think it's bad.  They were already making a profit and were successful.  This move just screws over people who already have a hard time affording homeownership and then they use cheap materials that cause them to spend money on repairs.  ,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,56,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7

the behavior is irresponsible as subpar materials will result in lower quality products that require more maintenance and repairs.  this is shday and greedy and not putting the needs of the customer first.,,,7,1,7,1,7,1,6,3,7,7,7,5,53,1,1,6,6,1,1,7,5,1,1,7

"I think it is very unethical behavior for two main reasons. First, the company was already profitable before deciding to start using poorer quality materials to build homes.
